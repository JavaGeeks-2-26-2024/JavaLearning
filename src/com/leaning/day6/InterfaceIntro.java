// An interface is a Completely abstarct class.
	
//to Access the interface methods, the interface must be implemented by another class with keyword 
//	called "implements"
	
	
//	interface can not be used to create objects.
//  in terface we can only have abstarct classes.
//	when any class implementing an interface, that class must provide the implemention for all of its methods
	//interface -> methods ->by default -> abstact and public 
   //	        -> Attributes  -> by default -> public , static and final.
//    An interface can not contain a constructor.
	
//	->  security 
//	 ->  by using interfaces we can impletement Multiple inheritance.
